# Tmux config
This is my tmux config. It uses the [Tmux Plugin Manager (TPM)](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
to install some plugins.

While they are all listed in the `tmux.conf` file, you might need to install them using
`prefix` + <kbd>I</kbd>.

## Default prefix
I use the default prefix `C-b`.
