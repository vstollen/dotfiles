# Dotfiles
My dotfiles. Managed using [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## Contents
Currently, I only have my:
- Neovim config
- ZSH config

I might add more configs in the future.

## Git hooks (pre-commit secret checking)
To enable the git hooks, run the following command:
```sh
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
```

## Questions
If you have any questions about my setup, don't hesitate to ask! I'll be happy to help you.
